## Challenge Summary
To design and implement a card shuffler using the language of your choice

Requirements: 
- Implementation should be done in a code repository that can be pulled down by an Altvia engineer
- Readme provided on how to run the project
- Showcase my skill set

## Project Delivery
For this project, I created a simple interface which will show the initial cards (numbered 1-52, like a card deck) upon page load. When the "Shuffle" button is clicked, the newly shuffled set of cards will be added to the DOM below the previous set along with text indicating how many times the deck has been shuffled.
